					Lead Free Buffalo
				</h2>
				<h3>
					The Lead Free Buffalo project aims to help Buffalo residents determine if they are at risk for exposure from lead pipes in their home.
				</h3>
				<p>
					Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal. Lead was used to make pipes, gasoline, and paint before its harmful effects were known. Many homes built during that time have lead pipes that can expose residents to harmful amounts of lead. Young children are most at risk, and may suffer permanent brain damage. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The signs of lead exposure in children include changes in behavior, reduced attention span, and learning difficulties. In adults, lead exposure can lead to anemia, hypertension (high blood pressure), problems with kidney function, and problems with the immune and reproductive systems. 
				</p>

					More lead exposure resources are available below:

					There are a number of resources available to homeowners with elevated risk of exposure to lead:
